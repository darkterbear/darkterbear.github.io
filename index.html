        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by! I’m a sophomore studying Electrical
          Engineering & Computer Science at UC Berkeley. <br /><br />

          Growing up in Seattle and having been exposed to technology and
          coding at a young age, I’ve always been interested in solving
          problems through software. At Berkeley, I have found communities who
          share my interest, and I’m grateful for the impact I can bring with
          my code.

        <h1>experience</h1>
        <p>
          During the summer of 2020, I was at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/community-cloud/overview/"
            target="blank">Salesforce</a> as a SWE intern! Read about my experience building accessibility features
          <a href="/blog/my-futureforce-internship-experience/" target="blank">here</a>. For the coming summer,
          I'll be a SWE intern at <a href="https://scale.com/">Scale AI</a>.
          <br />
          <br />

          I am a Client Project Manager for <a href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">CodeBase</a>,
          a student organization that partners on projects with industry clients! My team is working with Relativity
          Space on a real-time data streaming and visualization system, designed for their needs.
          <br />
          <br />

          I’m also a <a href="https://calhacks.io" target="_blank">Cal Hacks</a>
          Director! I handle the logistics and technical infrastructure
          needed to run the world’s largest collegiate hackathon.
          <br />
          <br />

          Before studying at Berkeley, I was a Research Assistant at the
          <a href="https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington Systems Laboratory</a>,
          building visualizations and demonstrations for various projects.

          As a full-stack developer, I have considerable experience in
          Node, React, Express, MongoDB, and
          Postgres. I’ve also extensively used Git and
          Ubuntu in my projects. Finally, I’m also fluent in
          Python and Java, though I haven’t built full-stack
          applications with these languages. <br /><br />

          I was also a former tech team lead for Cal Hacks! I created 
          our current tech infrastructure that goes behind running
          the world's largest collegiate hackathon, such as application
          portals, websites, and the like. Check out one of our projects
          <a href="https://hacknow.calhacks.io">here</a>!<br /><br />

          In CodeBase, I have the great opportunity to work with
          various client companies on their projects. My work for
          Storr involved building new features into their backend using
          GraphQL, and my work for DataStax consisted of building a
          data migration service for new clients.
          <br />
          <br />

          A notable past project of mine is for my high school’s math club. We
          host the annual
          Knights of Pi Math Tournament, one of Washington’s largest
          elementary/middle school math competitions. I built a full-stack
          application using React, Express, and MongoDB to streamline
          registration and scoring for the competition.
