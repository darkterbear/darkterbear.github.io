        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by! I’m a freshman studying Electrical
          Engineering & Computer Science at UC Berkeley. <br /><br />

          Growing up in Seattle and having been exposed to technology and
          coding at a young age, I’ve always been interested in solving
          problems through software. At Berkeley, I have found communities who
          share my interest, and I’m grateful for the impact I can bring with
          my code.

        <h1>experience</h1>
        <p>
          For the summer of 2020, I'll be joining the Communities Runtime team
          at
          <b><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/community-cloud/overview/">Salesforce</a></b>
          as a <b>Software Engineering Intern</b>! I'm excited to build cool
          things and see what life is like at Salesforce.
          <br />
          <br />

          I’m a
          <b><a href="https://calhacks.io" target="_blank">Cal Hacks</a>
            Director</b>! As the tech team lead, I write, deploy, and maintain the software
          infrastructure needed to run the world’s largest collegiate
          hackathon. <br /><br />

          I am also a
          <b>Client Developer for
            <a href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">CodeBase</a></b>, a student organization that
          write’s production code for client
          companies such as Atlassian and Postman. <br /><br />

          Before studying at Berkeley, I was a
          <b>Research Assistant at the
            <a href="https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington Systems
              Laboratory</a></b>, building visualizations and demonstrations for various projects.

        <p>
          As a full-stack developer, I have considerable experience in
          <b>Node</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>Express</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, and
          <b>Postgres</b>. I’ve also extensively used <b>Git</b> and
          <b>Ubuntu</b> in my projects. Finally, I’m also fluent in
          <b>Python</b> and <b>Java</b>, though I haven’t built full-stack
          applications with these languages. <br /><br />

          I am also the tech team lead for <b>Cal Hacks</b>! I'm responsible
          for all the technological infrastructure that goes behind running
          the world's largest collegiate hackathon, such as application
          portals, websites, and the like. Check out one of our projects
          <a href="https://hacknow.calhacks.io">here</a>!<br /><br />

          In <b>CodeBase</b>, I have the great opportunity to work with
          various client companies on their projects. My work for
          <b>Storr</b> involved building new features into their backend using
          GraphQL, and my work for <b>DataStax</b> consisted of building a
          data migration service for new clients.
          <br />
          <br />

          A notable past project of mine is for my high school’s math club. We
          host the annual
          <b>Knights of Pi Math Tournament</b>, one of Washington’s largest
          elementary/middle school math competitions. I built a full-stack
          application using React, Express, and MongoDB to streamline
          registration and scoring for the competition.
