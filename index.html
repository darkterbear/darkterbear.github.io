          <p>
            Thanks for stopping by! I’m a freshman studying Electrical
            Engineering & Computer Science at UC Berkeley. <br /><br />

            Growing up in Seattle and having been exposed to technology and
            coding at a young age, I’ve always been interested in solving
            problems through software. At Berkeley, I have found communities who
            share my interest, and I’m grateful for the impact I can bring with
            my code.

            infrastructure needed to run the world’s largest collegiate
            hackathon. <br /><br />

            I am also a

            As a full-stack developer, I have considerable experience in
            <b>Node</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>Express</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, and
            <b>Postgres</b>. I’ve also extensively used <b>Git</b> and
            <b>Ubuntu</b> in my projects. Finally, I’m also fluent in
            <b>Python</b> and <b>Java</b>, though I haven’t built full-stack
            applications with these languages. <br /><br />

            I’m currently working on a project for <b>Cal Hacks</b> as their
            tech team lead. The project is to overhaul our software
            infrastructure that supports the hackathon, including our website,
            application portal, and help queue. This is a work in progress :)
            <br /><br />

            A notable past project of mine is for my high school’s math club. We
            host the annual <b>Knights of Pi Math Tournament</b>, one of
            Washington’s largest elementary/middle school math competitions. I
            built a full-stack application using React, Express, and MongoDB to
            streamline registration and scoring for the competition.
