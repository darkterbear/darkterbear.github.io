        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by! I’m a 3rd-year studying Electrical
          Engineering & Computer Science at UC Berkeley. <br /><br />

          Growing up in Seattle and having been exposed to technology and
          coding at a young age, I’ve always been interested in solving
          problems through software. At Berkeley, I have found communities who
          share my interest, and I’m grateful for the impact I can bring with
          my code.
        </p>

        <h1>experience</h1>
        <p>
          During the summer of 2020, I was at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/community-cloud/overview/"
            target="blank">Salesforce</a> as a SWE intern! Read about my experience building accessibility features
          <a href="/blog/my-futureforce-internship-experience/" target="blank">here</a>. For this summer,
          I'll be a SWE intern on the Content & Language team at <a href="https://scale.com/" target="_blank">Scale AI</a>.
          <br />
          <br />

          I've been with <a href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Codebase</a> for 2 years. We are a 
          student organization that partners with industry clients on technical projects. I started as a Client Developer, 
          became a Client Project Manager, and I'm currently the VP of Projects. As such, I am responsible for supporting 
          my PMs and overseeing all projects end-to-end, from sourcing to final-deliverable.
          <br />
          <br />

          I’ve also been a <a href="https://calhacks.io" target="_blank">Cal Hacks</a>
          Director for 2 years, handling the logistics and technical infrastructure
          needed to run the world’s largest collegiate hackathon. I have stepped up as 
          an Executive Director, overseeing our transition back to in-person events with Cal Hacks 8.0.
          <br />
          <br />

          Before studying at Berkeley, I was a Research Assistant at the
          <a href="https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington Systems Laboratory</a>,
          building visualizations and demonstrations for various projects.

        <p>
          As a full-stack developer, I have experience in Node, React, Express, MongoDB, 
          Postgres, Git, and Ubuntu. I’m also fluent in Python and Java, with some exposure to C++ and C. <br /><br />

          Apart from my work in internships and clubs, I love working on side-projects! Here's some stuff I've built in the past...<br/>
          <ul>
            <li>Various card games like Hearts, Yikes (inspired by Red Flags)</li>
            <li>A prototype League of Legends clone; movement only, rolled my own netcode</li>
            <li>An algotrader (no, it didn't perform better than the market)</li>
            <li>A 3D-printed custom <a href="blog/building-a-drone/" target="_blank">drone</a></li>
            <li>This website and <a href="/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a></li>
          </ul>
          I'm currently working on multiplayer Mahjong (not the whitewashed Solitaire-version). Stay tuned!
