        Introduction

      <p>
        In the fall semester of 2019, I visited Salesforce Tower with <a href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu"
          target="blank">Codebase</a>, a club at Cal that works on industry
        projects with client companies. We learned what Salesforce is all about, and dropped off our resumes.
        Fast-forward a month, and I was going about my day when I received my offer letter from Salesforce. Strap in as
        I take you through my experience as a Futureforce Intern!

        First, a little about Salesforce. Salesforce is large, and many people have heard of us. Yet, many are still
        confused: “what does Salesforce do?” There is no simple answer, since we do many things. But, they all revolve
        around connecting businesses to their customers. They offer a range of services such as analytics,
        website-builders, and marketing to help businesses better interact with their customers. I worked as a part of
        the Communities Runtime team in the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/community-cloud/overview/"
          target="blank">Communities Cloud</a>. What does that mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        Communities Cloud is a Salesforce product; it enables users to build light web applications (also known as
        Experiences) and integrate their Salesforce data into those applications. Some examples include e-commerce
        storefront pages and <a
          href="https://help.hulu.com/s/?language=en_US%3F&utm_term=+hulu++support&gclid=CjwKCAjwjqT5BRAPEiwAJlBuBZM0AYezgRC4GDh79dY_AedTxNZ5wMVmbL5k5ulpQMGGttYm4pCDCRoC3P0QAvD_BwE&utm_campaign=BM+SEM+Customer+Service+Keywords&cmp=9241&utm_medium=cpc&gclsrc=aw.ds&utm_source=google"
          target="blank">customer support pages</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Communities Experiences are built with Lightning Web Runtime (LWR), a static-site generator that turns
        user-generated data (like templates, content, drag-and-dropped layouts, etc.) into a full-fledged website.
