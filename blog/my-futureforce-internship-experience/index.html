        Introduction
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the fall semester of 2019, I visited Salesforce Tower with <a href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu"
          target="blank">Codebase</a>, a club at Cal that works on industry
        projects with client companies. We learned what Salesforce is all about, and dropped off our resumes.
        Fast-forward a month, and I was going about my day when I received my offer letter from Salesforce. Strap in as
        I take you through my experience as a Futureforce Intern!

        COVID
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's worth noting that this internship took place during the height of the worldwide COVID pandemic. Salesforce
        took the safe and precautionary measure of having employees work from home. Although I wasn't able to experience
        free snacks and lunches in person, my team and the Futureforce program did a fantastic job of making sure the
        logistics of working remotely went smoothly.

        My Team
      </h1>
      <p>
        First, a little about Salesforce. Salesforce is large, and many people have heard of us. Yet, many are still
        confused: “what does Salesforce do?” There is no simple answer, since we do many things. But, they all revolve
        around connecting businesses to their customers. They offer a range of services such as analytics,
        website-builders, and marketing to help businesses better interact with their customers. I worked as a part of
        the Communities Runtime team in the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/community-cloud/overview/"
          target="blank">Communities Cloud</a>. What does that mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        Communities Cloud is a Salesforce product; it enables users to build light web applications (also known as
        Experiences) and integrate their Salesforce data into those applications. Some examples include e-commerce
        storefront pages and <a
          href="https://help.hulu.com/s/?language=en_US%3F&utm_term=+hulu++support&gclid=CjwKCAjwjqT5BRAPEiwAJlBuBZM0AYezgRC4GDh79dY_AedTxNZ5wMVmbL5k5ulpQMGGttYm4pCDCRoC3P0QAvD_BwE&utm_campaign=BM+SEM+Customer+Service+Keywords&cmp=9241&utm_medium=cpc&gclsrc=aw.ds&utm_source=google"
          target="blank">customer support pages</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Communities Experiences are built with Lightning Web Runtime (LWR), a static-site generator that turns
        user-generated data (like templates, content, drag-and-dropped layouts, etc.) into a full-fledged website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting two and two together, the Communities Runtime team is in charge of building this scalable runtime
        platform that other Salesforce teams and customers build their digital experiences on.

      <h5>Meet my team!</h5>

      <h1 id="project" class="section-title">
        My Project
      </h1>
      <p>
        My task for the summer is to build accessibility features into LWR. Being red-green colorblind myself, I know
        exactly what it feels like when something just wasn’t built for you (I’m looking at you, subway maps).
        Accessibility is so often overlooked as a feature, added as an afterthought, or straight up forgotten, despite
        it sometimes being a legal requirement.
      </p>
      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p>When we think of disability and accessibility, we often think of wheelchairs, blind individuals, and special
        reserved parking spots. There are 3 types of disability, which demonstrates how we all benefit from
        accessibility features.</p>
      <img style="max-width: 500px;"
        src="https://files.terranceli.com/blog/my-futureforce-internship-experience/types-of-disabilities.png" />
      <h5>Permanent, temporary, and situational disability examples</h5>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Permanent disability</b>: this one is what it sounds like. Examples include permanent blindness, missing
          limbs, and permanent hearing loss.</li>
        <li><b>Temporary disability</b>: disabilities that are expected to resolve in time. Examples include broken
          bones and concussions.</li>
        <li><b>Situational disability</b>: disabilities that are the result of a certain circumstance. Say I’m a janitor
          trying to bring a large cart of equipment into the building through a flight of stairs. In this context, I
          would be situationally disabled, since it is practically impossible to drag a cart of equipment up a flight of
          stairs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Say the designers of the building were considerate enough to include a ramp into the building in addition to the
        flight of stairs. This benefits not only those with permanent and temporary disabilities, but also those who are
        situationally disabled! Even though it was designed with the wheelchair in mind, it also serves the janitor with
        the cart full of equipment. If we design and develop products with accessibility in mind, we can make life
        easier for everyone.
      </p>
      <img src="https://files.terranceli.com/blog/my-futureforce-internship-experience/accessible-ramp.jpg" />
      <h5>An accessible ramp is beneficial for everyone</h5>
      <p>My project concerns users who rely on keyboard navigation and screen-readers. Many of us are familiar with
        keyboard navigation; this is when you hit tab to go through a form on a webpage (another example of
        accessibility features benefitting us all). <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Screen_reader" target="blank">Screen-readers</a> are
        audio devices that read out screen contents to users who have trouble seeing things on a screen. I’ll be going
        over the features that I built into LWR to support these users.</p>
      <h2>F6 Navigation</h2>
      <p>This one’s for all you keyboard navigators out there. Have you ever tried to TAB through a gigantic form and
        end up with a cramping pinky finger? This feature solves that problem by allowing you to F6 through larger
        regions first, then TAB within that region to your element of choice. Simple, right?</p>
      <img src="https://files.terranceli.com/blog/my-futureforce-internship-experience/f6.png" />
      <h5>Navigating to the footer with F6 navigation</h5>

      <h2>Navigation Page Title Update and ARIA-Live Announcement</h2>
      <p>LWR generates a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA" target="blank">Single Page
          Application (SPA)</a>, meaning navigation within the app is handled by a Javascript
        bundle that dynamically modifies the DOM to simulate navigation. This poses quite a few problems for
        accessibility, the first of which is that navigation is not natively announced. Even if you don’t use a
        screen-reader, you can see how this could be problematic; there is no confirming feedback to the user that they
        have navigated! I fixed this in two ways: first, by updating the page title on navigation, and second, by
        updating an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions"
          target="blank">ARIA-Live region</a> to “force” the screen-reader to read out the new page title.</p>

      <img src="https://files.terranceli.com/blog/my-futureforce-internship-experience/aria-live.png" />
      <h5>Invisible ARIA Live region injected into the DOM</h5>

      <h2>Navigation Focus Update</h2>
      <p>
        The second accessibility problem with navigating in an SPA is that the focus doesn’t always end up where it
        needs to be after navigation. For instance, it might be left in the footer if the footer isn’t rerendered, where
        the user expects it to be back at the top. This is, again, fixed by simply updating the focus to the top of the
        page or to the content region.

        What I Learned
      </h1>
      <h2>About WebComponents</h2>
      <p>
        Before my internship, I had never heard of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components"
          target="blank">WebComponents</a> or the <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM" target="blank">shadow
          DOM</a>. Turns out, if you’ve used HTML,
        chances are, you’ve also used WebComponents!
      </p>
      <p>WebComponents is not a framework like React; it is a lower level structure that defines the “built-in” behavior
        of elements we take for granted, like <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>. A WebComponent has its own bundle of HTML,
        CSS, and JS that makes
        it work. In fact, for encapsulation, WebComponents have their own internal DOM tree (known as a shadow DOM) when
        rendered on a webpage. You can even nest components inside each other!</p>
      <p>
        LWR is built on <a
          href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2018/12/introducing-lightning-web-components.html#:~:text=Lightning%20Web%20Components%20is%20the,in%20ECMAScript%207%20and%20beyond."
          target="blank">Lightning Web Components (LWC)</a>, which is highly similar to WebComponents. To build my
        features
        into LWR, I often had to interact with the shadow DOMs of various components, something that was foreign to me,
        but I am glad to have had the experience.
      </p>
      <h2>About Accessibility</h2>
      <p>To complete the screen-reader features, I had to use a screen-reader myself. I closed my eyes and enabled
        VoiceOver, and attempted to navigate to a website using Google. How hard could it be?</p>
      <p>
        Immediately, I got stuck. How do I move my cursor to the search bar? What is even on my screen? Why is it
        reading so fast? I gained a new respect for those who rely on accessibility features and a sense of duty as a
        developer after my experience with a screen-reader.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned not only about how some disabled people interact with technology in their day-to-day lives, but also
        how accessibility features help everyone, not just those who are permanently disabled. I learned the importance
        of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML" target="blank">semantic HTML</a>,
        and thought about all those times I used buttons in the place of anchor tags. I learned about
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA" target="blank">ARIA</a>, a set of web
        page accessibility features that some glance over in Inspect Element but few know their
        function. Most importantly, I’ve gained a greater empathy for my users from all walks of life.
      </p>
      <h2>About Software Development</h2>
      <p>I would consider myself an experienced software developer for a 19-year-old. I’ve coded at hackathons,
        developed software for small client projects, worked long hours for a startup, built cool projects for a lab,
        and led a tech team for a student organization. However, this was my first experience as a software engineer in
        a tech giant. As big as Salesforce is as a company, the codebase is even larger, along with the surrounding
        development infrastructure. I, specifically, want to focus on <b>testing</b>. I’ve written a few JUnit and Jest
        tests
        before in my life, but nothing that would prepare me for how seriously and rigorously testing is done here.</p>

      <p>Before a feature is completed, a test plan is created. This plan includes info on what types of tests are
        needed, and what specific test cases are there. Do we need end to end testing? Do we need performance testing?
        Localization testing? What about accessibility testing?</p>

      <p>After I’m done writing a feature, I write some Jest unit tests along with it, mocking out certain functionality
        to isolate the individual components. After that, I’ll write some WebDriver tests to ensure that the
        functionality works end-to-end, when the module itself is running separate from the Salesforce core application.
        Then, I’ll write some Selenium tests that make sure my feature functions when it is integrated into core.
        Finally, I'll do some performance analysis in Chrome Dev Tools to ensure that my feature isn’t burning someone’s
        lap. Needless to say, of the time I spent in the code editor, the majority of it was on writing tests. As
        monotonous as test-writing is, I admire Salesforce’s dedication to Trust as a core value, and the rigorous
        testing is a testament to Trust.</p>
      <h1 id="acknowledgements" class="section-title">
        Acknowledgements
      </h1>
      <p>There are two people I’d like to thank in particular: Ronak, my manager, and Bob, my mentor. Ronak has been
        with me through my entire journey, always checking in on me to make sure everything was going smoothly. In
        addition to being a great leader and manager, he is also a great friend to whom I can chat about life with. Bob
        is quick to provide me with the resources I need to learn and become independent, and he was able to make me
        feel at home despite being a new member on the team.</p>

      <p>Also a huge shout-out to Bobby (my recruiter), Zach (my product manager), Donielle (for teaching me all about
        accessibility), and Stephen (for answering so many of my questions)!</p>
